This eclectic predecessor of house music appeared to materialize out of nothing, but according to the makers of The Sound of Belgium, it was the product of a historical search for identity that apparently went back to the Battle of Waterloo and the aftermath of the First World War.",

            "overview": "When Thomas Ostermeier, artistic director of the Schaub\u00fchne in Berlin, decided to go to Ramallah in September 2012 to stage Hamlet at the invitation of the Al-Kasaba Theatre, he knew that the Shakespearean verses would find a particular resonance there. The idea of the trip came from intense contact with theatre professionals in Palestine, and most especially with the Freedom Theatre in the refugee camp in Jenin. Under the watchful eye of the film director Nicolas Klotz, the tragedy of the Danish prince intersects with that of young Palestinians. The film is, moreover, a view on another tragedy: the murder of Juliano Mer Khamis, the former director of Freedom Theatre, killed by an unknown assassin in April 2011.",
