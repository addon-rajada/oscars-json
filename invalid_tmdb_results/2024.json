By analyzing his astonishing roles in iconic films through the years, the documentary reveal the complex actor behind these extreme characters. Because the public knows little about the man who is largely silent about his own life and emotions, this film tries to unwraps one of the most fascinating and enigmatic American actors of all time for the audience. For this the filmakers use clips from his feature films, archive footage of his sparse interviews and probe into his background to illustrate De Niro\u2019s methods for becoming the characters he plays and the reasons he\u2019s able to do so. All of this culminates in a rare expos\u00e9 of the genesis of the hidden pain that enables the masterful actor to bring such intensity to the big screen.",
